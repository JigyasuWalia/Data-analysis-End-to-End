# Data-analysis-End-to-End
End to End project on Data Analysis using Python, SQL and PowerBi. Project inspired by similar project made By Ankit Bansal on youtube, very insightful and educating.

In this project I took a dataset from kaggle and used Kaggle Api to get the dataset in python, worked on the dataset using pandas library and cleaned the dataset.

Further added the cleaned table to Sql server and ran few queries on it for analysis. From there connected the sql server to PowerBi and created a basic dashboard for visualisation.
